## Key Topics Learned
I feel more comfortable now using Flexbox to organize and align elements on the page, which has made it easier to build responsive layouts. I'm also getting better at structuring and labeling my HTML in a clear and consistent way, which helps keep my code organized and easier to understand. In addition to what was asked of this assignment, I challenged myself by adding links to additional pages, each with their own styling using a separate pages.css file. This helped me practice working with multiple HTML and CSS files and gave me more hands-on experience managing navigation and styles across a small website.
